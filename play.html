            _Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house_.
        </p>

        <p>
            [LORD GORING, _dressed in the height of fashion_, _is lounging in an
            armchair_. SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _is standing in front of the fireplace_.
            _He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress_.
            _As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room_.]
            LORD GORING. Is Lady Chiltern as perfect as all that?
        </p>


        <h6 class="sir-robert-chiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Yes; my wife is as perfect as all that.</p>

        LORD GORING.
        <p class="name stage-direction">[_Taking off his left-hand glove_.]</p>
        <p class="speech">What a pity! I beg
            your pardon, my dear fellow, I didn’t quite mean that. But if what you
            tell me is true, I should like to have a serious talk about life with
            Lady Chiltern.
        </p>

        <h6 class="name sir-robert-chiltern">ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">It would be quite useless.
        </p>
        <h6 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING.</h6>
        <p class="speech">May I try?
        </p>

        <h6 class="name sir-robert-chiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Yes; but nothing could make her alter her views.
        </p>
        <h6 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological
            experiment.
        </p>

        <h6 class="name sir-robert-chiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">All such experiments are terribly dangerous.
        </p>

        <h6 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow. If it wasn’t so,
            life wouldn’t be worth living. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think
            you should have told her years ago.
        </p>

        <h6 class="name sir-robert-chiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">When? When we were engaged? Do you think she
            would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is
            such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that I had done
            a thing that I suppose most men would call shameful and dishonourable?
        </p>

        <h6 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Slowly_.]</p>
        <p class="speech">Yes; most men would call it ugly names. There
            is no doubt of that.
        </p>

        <h6 class="name sir-robert-chiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Bitterly_.]</p>
        <p class="speech">Men who every day do something of
            the same kind themselves. Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets
            in their own lives.
        </p>

        <h6 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING.</h6>
        <p class="speech">That is the reason they are so pleased to find out other
            people’s secrets. It distracts public attention from their own.
        </p>
        <h6 class="name sir-robert-chiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">And, after all, whom did I wrong by what I did? No
            one.
        </p>

        <h6 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Looking at him steadily_.]</p>
        <p class="speech">Except yourself, Robert.
        </p>

        <h6 class="name sir-robert-chiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_After a pause_.]</p>
        <p class="speech">Of course I had private
            information about a certain transaction contemplated by the Government of
            the day, and I acted on it. Private information is practically the
            source of every large modern fortune.
        </p>

        <h6 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Tapping his boot with his cane_.]</p>
        <p class="speech">And public scandal
            invariably the result.
        </p>

        <h6 class="name sir-robert-chiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Pacing up and down the room_.]</p>
        <p class="speech">Arthur, do you
            think that what I did nearly eighteen years ago should be brought up
            against me now? Do you think it fair that a man’s whole career should be
            ruined for a fault done in one’s boyhood almost? I was twenty-two at the
            time, and I had the double misfortune of being well-born and poor, two
            unforgiveable things nowadays. Is it fair that the folly, the sin of
            one’s youth, if men choose to call it a sin, should wreck a life like
            mine, should place me in the pillory, should shatter all that I have
            worked for, all that I have built up. Is it fair, Arthur?
        </p>
        <h6 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Life is never fair, Robert. And perhaps it is a good thing
            for most of us that it is not.
        </p>
        <h6 class="name sir-robert-chiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Every man of ambition has to fight his century with
            its own weapons. What this century worships is wealth. The God of this
            century is wealth. To succeed one must have wealth. At all costs one
            must have wealth.
        </p>
        <h6 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING.</h6>
        <p class="speech">You underrate yourself, Robert. Believe me, without wealth
            you could have succeeded just as well.
        </p>
        <h6 class="name sir-robert-chiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">When I was old, perhaps. When I had lost my
            passion for power, or could not use it. When I was tired, worn out,
            disappointed. I wanted my success when I was young. Youth is the time
            for success. I couldn’t wait.
        </p>

        <h6 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Well, you certainly have had your success while you are
            still young. No one in our day has had such a brilliant success.
            Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs at the age of forty—that’s good
            enough for any one, I should think.
        </p>
        <h6 class="name sir-robert-chiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">And if it is all taken away from me now? If I lose
            everything over a horrible scandal? If I am hounded from public life?
        </p>
        <h6 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Robert, how could you have sold yourself for money?
        </p>
        <h6 class="name sir-robert-chiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
        <p class="name sir-robert-chiltern">[_Excitedly_.]</p>
        <p class="speech">I did not sell myself for money. I
            bought success at a great price. That is all.
        </p>
        <h6 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING.</h6>
        <p class="name sir-robert-chiltern">[_Gravely_.]</p>
        <p class="speech">Yes; you certainly paid a great price for it.
            But what first made you think of doing such a thing?
