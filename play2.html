    <h6 class="sir-robert-chiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p>Yes; my wife is as perfect as all that.

    <h6 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Taking off his left-hand glove_.]</p>
    <p class="name speech">What a pity! I beg
        your pardon, my dear fellow, I didn’t quite mean that. But if what you
        tell me is true, I should like to have a serious talk about life with
        Lady Chiltern.
    </p>

    <h6 class="name sir-robert-chiltern">ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p class="speech">It would be quite useless.
    </p>
    <h6 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <p class="speech">May I try?
    </p>

    <h6 class="name sir-robert-chiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Yes; but nothing could make her alter her views.
    </p>
    <h6 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological
        experiment.
    </p>

    <h6 class="name sir-robert-chiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p class="speech">All such experiments are terribly dangerous.
    </p>

    <h6 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow. If it wasn’t so,
        life wouldn’t be worth living. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think
        you should have told her years ago.
    </p>

    <h6 class="name sir-robert-chiltern">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p class="speech"> When? When we were engaged? Do you think she
        would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is
        such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that I had done
        a thing that I suppose most men would call shameful and dishonourable?
    </p>

    <h6 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Slowly_.]</p>
    <p class="speech">Yes; most men would call it ugly names. There
        is no doubt of that.
